# OTC DNS - the complete example
==============================

DNS services are provided by OTC since months. Now the complete stack
is reworked so we can take a closer look on API service.

![OTC Dashboard](/pictures/otc-dns.png)

The service is located on the dashboard in the network services area.
There are 3 main features as you can see on the screen:

* Public Zones
* Private Zones
* PTR-Records

Private Zones and PTR-Records are completly new. If you have older 
implementation with setup reverse zones, please update to the new one.
A good thing: it's simple!
